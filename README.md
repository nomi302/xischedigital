# Billing System API

## Overview
This project implements a billing system with discount calculation and currency conversion features. The API integrates with an external **Exchange Rate API (open.er-api.com)** to fetch real-time exchange rates.

## Features
- Calculates bill amounts with applicable discounts.
- Converts the total bill amount to a target currency.
- Uses caching (In-Memory) to optimize exchange rate requests.
- Provides authentication using API Key.

## Technologies Used
- **Java 17**  
- **Spring Boot**  
- **Spring Security** (for API key authentication)  
- **Spring Cache** (for exchange rate caching)  
- **JUnit & Mockito** (for testing)  
- **MockMvc** (for API testing)
